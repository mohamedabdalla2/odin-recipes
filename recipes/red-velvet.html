      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, crimson, or scarlet corlored layered cake with ermine icing. Traditional recipes did not use food coloring with the red color 
          possible due to non-Dutched, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin"><i>anthrocyanin</i></a>-rich cocoa and possibly due to the usage of brown sugar, 
          formally called red sugar.Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with a French-style butter ermine icing (also called roux icing though, while containing butter and flour, it is not made from a roux),[10] 
          which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to prepare. Cream cheese frosting and buttercream frosting are variations that have increased in popularity</p>

      <h4>Icing</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup milk</li> 
          <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
          <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans</li>
      <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
        until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
      <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
      <li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table 
        knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until 
        frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
