      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, crimson, or scarlet corlored layered cake with ermine icing. Traditional recipes did not use food coloring with the red color 
          possible due to non-Dutched, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin"><i>anthrocyanin</i></a>-rich cocoa and possibly due to the usage of brown sugar, 
          formally called red sugar.Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with a French-style butter ermine icing (also called roux icing though, while containing butter and flour, it is not made from a roux),[10] 
          which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to prepare. Cream cheese frosting and buttercream frosting are variations that have increased in popularity</p>
